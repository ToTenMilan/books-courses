# A Dockerfile is a set of instructions to build an image, which can
# be used to start a container.

# The first line MUST be the FROM directory and it specified the name
# of the base image on which this image will be built. This uses
# the official Ruby base image, version 3.2.
#
# Note that this imagfe is a multi-architecture image, so if you build
# this on an M2 Mac, it will use a ARM-based base image. If you use a Linux
# computer with an Intel chip, it will use an AMD-based image.
FROM ruby:3.2

# The base image is based on Debian, and we use apt to install packages.  Apt
# will use the DEBIAN_FRONTEND environment variable to allow limited control
# in its behavior.  In this case, we don't want it to ask interactive questions
# as that will make the docker build command appear to be hung.
ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive

# Typically the first RUN directive updates apt-get and then installs system level packages
# that aren't in the base image.  The base image is quite filled with packages, but it
# doesn't have rsync, which some of the automation needs.
RUN apt-get update -q && \
    apt-get install -qy rsync

# Next, we install Node 18.  This is based on the official instructions
# available from https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#using-debian-as-root-2
# This also installs Yarn.  Since each RUN directive is a cached layer, we
# want layers to be logically cohesive.
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash - && \
    apt-get install -y nodejs && \
    npm install -g yarn

# This installs the postgres client, version 15.  Ideally this verison is consistent with the 
# version in docker-compose.dx.yml.  The client is needed to allow installation of the pg
# gem.
#
# These instructions were pieced together from https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/
RUN apt-get -y install lsb-release && \
    sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list' && \
		wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | apt-key add - && \
		apt-get update && \
		apt-get -y install postgresql-client-15

# This installs Chromium and chromium-driver, both of which are required
# to run system tests in Rails.  The reason this uses Chromium and not Chrome
# is that Chrome is not available for ARM-based installations. Meaning: if you
# are using an M1 or M2 Mac, chrome inside Linux running in Docker does not work.
# Chromium does.
RUN apt-get -y install chromium chromium-driver

# Now, we set up RubyGems to avoid building documentation. We don't need the docs
# inside this image and it slows down gem installation to have them.
# We also install the latest bundler as well as Rails.  Lastly, to help debug stuff inside
# the container, I need vi mode on the command line and vim to be installed.  These can be 
# omitted and aren't needed by the Rails toolchain.
RUN gem update --system && \
    echo "gem: --no-document" >> ~/.gemrc && \
    gem install bundler && \
    echo "set -o vi" >> ~/.bashrc && \

# Rails uses the BINDING environment variable to allow linstening on 
# differen thostnames  This value, 0.0.0.0 allows it to respond on
# localhost:3000.  Without this, you'd need to use `--binding` on the
# command line to `bin/rails server`
ENV BINDING="0.0.0.0"

# This sets up an SSH server that you should not use as a reference for running
# SSH in production :)  It's here because the toolchain used for writing
# the book will ssh into the container and run the commands/edit the code
# the way the book says to.  The server being run here will only be available
# to containers on the same network, so this is generally safe, but if it
# bothers you, you can safely remove this RUN directive as well as
# the COPY and RUN directives that follow it.
